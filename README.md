## Reflection

Things I have learn

- Protocol-oriented programming
- MVVM (Model View View Model) Architecture
- Error Handling

With Protocol-Oriented programming, I found it the code to be more reusable accross the app. For example, in this app, I have made a CardView which have a content of View. This CardView acts as a component that can be used accross other Views, which provides consistency of user interface.

I have learned much about MVVM architecture. MVVM is much more efficient in delivering information-responsive app, which takes over MVC architecture. Since I am working with instant data updates for posts and events, it is important these data is updated accross the app once a user share a new post.

When developing this app, I have approached error handling methodoly using try catch. Errors are handled by View Model and thrown to View for error display. When user is entering incorrect information, error text will appear to show the user what is he/she doing wrong.
